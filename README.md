# PornList

- ad-blocking porn websites filter list for [Adblock Plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adblock_Plus) and [uBlock Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBlock_Origin)
- recommended for use with uBlock Origin though still will partially work with Adblock Plus too (but not so efficiently)
- the first and only such standalone filter list on the internet
- works as a supplement for main filter lists (like EasyList etc.)
- blocks ads/popups/fake thumbs/fake redirections/spam bookmark buttons and more
- saves resources like ram/memory/cpu/bandwidth and incerase website loading speed  
by blocking unnecessary files that load in the background with the website
- 18+ adult warnings popups/messages, due to legal reasons, are not to be blocked  
- all languages/domains supported
- this is just the beginning, so contributors / issues / pull requests wanted and welcome  
(valuable contributors will be given write permissions on the project)
